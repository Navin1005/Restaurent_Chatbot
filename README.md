# Restaurent_Chatbot
In this project, I led the design and implementation of a comprehensive chatbot solution tailored for the restaurant industry. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, I designed intents to facilitate seamless interactions for tasks such as food ordering, menu inquiries, and general user queries. Furthermore, I integrated backend processing via GitHub fulfillment to ensure efficient handling of user requests. This project not only showcased my proficiency in NLP but also demonstrated my ability to deliver user-centric solutions through effective collaboration and problem-solving.
